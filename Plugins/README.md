# Installation

### How to install plugins:
**Step 1:** Put the plugin's .cs file into the `./plugins/` folder. If it's not there, make a new folder and put it in there.

**Step 2:** Either in-game or via the server console, type `/pcompile [plugin name]`. It should say `Plugin compiled successfully.`, if it doesn't, make an issue [here](https://github.com/TeamEpicLegends/Released-Custom-Plugins-Commands/issues).

**Step 3:** Now type `/pload [plugin name]`. It should say `Plugin loaded successfully`.

## And you're done, enjoy your new plugin!
